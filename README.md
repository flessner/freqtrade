# Flessner's [freqtrade](https://www.freqtrade.io) Collection

Most strategies are modified versions of preexisting ones,
I have tried to include the original source where possible.

I am no longer actively using freqtrade, but I can recommend
the `FX1` and `FX2` hyperopts - they served me well in the past.

Maybe this helps someone, enjoy! üëã
